Welcome to your new Firebase Module!

Here you can initialieze, authorize, and store your data with Firebase.

As a warning, using Firebase Hosting without Firebase Functions will expose your Firebase API keys in the frontend build pack.

In order to fully secure those keys and any other sensitive information included in your final build, you will need to implement Firebase Functions, or another build/hosting platform.

In order to get started, initialize a new Firebase app in your Firebase console, and copy the associated keys into a `.env` file with 'REACT_APP_' prefixes, as seen in the /src/services/firebase-init.service.js Class.

After each Firebase operation, results are viewable either directly in the User Interface, or in the developer console.
